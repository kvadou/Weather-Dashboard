# Weather-Dashboard

Developed a basic weather dashboard to be used by a traveler that wants to view the 5 day weather forecast for mutiple cities.  Utilized a third-party API called OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and display on the browser featuring dynamically updated HTML & CSS.  Utilized local storage to store persistent data & display recent city searches in the browser.
